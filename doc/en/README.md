## Introduction

### What is easyUploader

EasyUploader is a lightweight js file upload library. It is developed based on HTML5、canvas、 fileReader and other technologies. It is more suitable for the use of mobile. Due to the different HTML support conditions of PC browsers, their use is limited, especially Internet explorer browsers. Flash will be considered to upload files in the later stage. It does not depend on other js libraries.

### Why develop

File upload is very common in web development, and there are many existing upload libraries (webuploader uploaderfy, etc.). But the feeling is still heavy, not light enough, and want to control as much as possible and familiar with the source code. Therefore, I came up with the idea of developing an upload library and considered making it as simple and practical as possible. By the way, I can learn a lot of knowledge (HTML5 canvas closure tools, etc.).
